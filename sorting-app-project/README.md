# sorting-app-project



## Getting started

This is a Sorting App which uses Bubble Sort method to sort given array.

## Specifications

User can pass arguments via terminal or using Arguments class.

Argument type can be double.

If array's length is null, program throws exception.


## Test Cases

There are many ready Unit Test Cases to run and check the correct flow of the program.

There are bunch of Parametrized Tests using CsvFileSource.

I have covered many corner cases, which ensures sorting algorithm works well.

Used JUnit 4.12

## Logging

I have used Log4j for logging, as well as java.util.logging.

Two log files are created - one for main class and the second for test class.

Added SimpleFormater for better experience.

## Other Info

Used Maven to build project with Java 8, model version 4.0.0

JAR file is ready to go.
